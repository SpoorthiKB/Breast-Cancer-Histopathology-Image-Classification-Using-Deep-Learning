# Breast-Cancer-Histopathology-Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

Project Overview:

Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women globally. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in successful treatment. Histopathological examination of tissue biopsies remains the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. However, this process can be subjective and time-consuming. Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating breast cancer classification from histopathology images, potentially leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses.

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying breast cancer histopathology images into benign or malignant categories.
